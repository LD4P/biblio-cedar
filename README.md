# LD4 requirements for linked data tools

A place to track LD4 requirements for tools, most immediately useful as a short-term wish list for CEDAR and BiblioPortal improvements that support LD4P work, but more generally useful to track a wide range of requirements for editors, ontology repositories, and more.
